# Python-for-Beginners---The-Complete-Course
Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.  Our Python Lecture  will guide you to learn Python one step at a time.
